# Jacksum File Browser Integration on macOS

The scripts in ./bin can create an .app and wraps it in a .dmg for macOS.
The core of the .app is bash script that installs Jacksum's primary features to macOS Finder's Script Menu by creating applescript scripts and compiling those on the system during the installation. The .app has been created with Platypus, a great GUI wrapper for scripts on macOS, see also https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus

The .app requires Mac OS X 10.8 or later.
