# Jacksum File Browser Integration on macOS

The installer script can install Jacksum's primary features to macOS Finder's Script Menu.

The script requires Mac OS X 10.4 or later in order to run properly.
It expects both jacksum-x.y.z.jar and license.txt in the same directory where the script is stored.
